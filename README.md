This project is a React-based decentralized application (dApp) designed for a restaurant. It aims to offer a unique loyalty program where customers who complete 100 orders receive an NFT (Non-Fungible Token) as a reward. The Dapp has a user interface that includes:

Header and Main Content: The main area of the application where users can interact, place orders, and see their account information. Itâ€™s styled to be responsive and user-friendly.

NFT Loyalty Feature: A key feature of the application is the NFT loyalty reward system. When a customer completes 100 orders, they are rewarded with an NFT, which could represent exclusive benefits, discounts, or simply a token of achievement.
